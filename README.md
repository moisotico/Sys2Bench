<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

We examine the reasoning and planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. Recent advances in inference-time techniques demonstrate the potential to enhance LLM reasoning without additional training by exploring intermediate steps during inference.

Key Contributions:
* We explore how scaling inference-time techniques can improve reasoning and planning, focusing on understanding the tradeoff between computational cost and performance.
* To this end, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, known as **Sys2Bench**, and perform extensive experiments evaluating existing inference-time techniques on eleven diverse tasks across five categories, including arithmetic reasoning, logical reasoning, common sense reasoning, algorithmic reasoning, and planning.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the repository and start using it.

### Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have the following installed:
* Conda or Miniconda - <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/"> Installation Guide </a> 
* Python >= 3.10
* CUDA >= 12.0
  
You can install Miniconda with Python 3.10 or later on Linux using:
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda3
$HOME/miniconda3/bin/conda init
source ~/.bashrc 
```

**API Keys**

To use OpenAI's models, you need an API Key. We also use DeepInfra for running LLaMa models, but this is optional since these models can be run locally as well.
* OpenAI API Key (Required)
  - Sign up or login at <a href='https://platform.openai.com/signup/'> OpenAI </a>
  - Navigate to API keys and create a new key.
* Export the API key (Linux)
    ```sh
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ``` 
* The same can be done for <a href='https://deepinfra.com/'> DeepInfra </a> as well, if you do make sure to export the token `export DEEPINFRA_TOKEN='your token here'` same way as OpenAI.

### Installation

To make the installation easy, we provide a step by step instruction of how to setup our repo and get started.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/divelab/sys2bench.git
   ```
2. Set Python Path
   ```sh
   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/repo/sys2bench:$PYTHONPATH
   ```
3. Run `setup.sh`, this file takes care of conda environment installation, and environment variables.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage  

This section explains how to run all experiments at once or execute specific methods individually, either via shell scripts or Python.

### Running the Complete Sys2Bench Suite  
To run all experiments in one go, execute the `sys2bench.sh` script. This will automatically run all experiments together:  

```sh
bash sys2bench.sh
```

### Running Specific Methods via Shell Scripts  
If you prefer to run specific methods, each method has a corresponding shell script that outlines the necessary arguments. You can simply execute these scripts from the terminal for a quick setup.  

Example: Running **Chain of Thought (CoT)** on the **GSM8K** dataset:  
```sh
bash methods/CoT/gsm8k/cot.sh
```

### Running Specific Methods via Python  
Alternatively, you can run each method by passing the required arguments to the `inference.py` script associated with the dataset and method. This approach allows customization of parameters for experimentation.  

Example: Running **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** on the **Game 24** dataset:  
```sh
python methods/ToT/game24/inference.py --base_lm openai --n_beam 5 --depth_limit 4 --openai_model gpt-4o-mini
```

Feel free to tweak the arguments to experiment with different configurations! 🚀
